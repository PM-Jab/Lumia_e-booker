  `Ispent my college years working as a valet at a nice hotel in Los Angeles.
One frequent guest was a technology executive. He was a genius, having
designed and patented a key component in Wi-Fi routers in his 20s. He had
started and sold several companies. He was wildly successful.
He also had a relationship with money I’d describe as a mix of insecurity and
childish stupidity.
He carried a stack of hundred dollar bills several inches thick. He showed it
to everyone who wanted to see it and many who didn’t. He bragged openly
and loudly about his wealth, often while drunk and always apropos of
nothing.
One day he handed one of my colleagues several thousand dollars of cash and
said, “Go to the jewelry store down the street and get me a few $1,000 gold
coins.”
An hour later, gold coins in hand, the tech executive and his buddies gathered
around by a dock overlooking the Pacific Ocean. They then proceeded to
throw the coins into the sea, skipping them like rocks, cackling as they
argued whose went furthest. Just for fun.

Days later he shattered a lamp in the hotel’s restaurant. A manager told him it
was a $500 lamp and he’d have to replace it.
“You want five hundred dollars?” the executive asked incredulously, while
pulling a brick of cash from his pocket and handing it to the manager.
“Here’s five thousand dollars. Now get out of my face. And don’t ever insult
me like that again.”
You may wonder how long this behavior could last, and the answer was “not
long.” I learned years later that he went broke.
The premise of this book is that doing well with money has a little to do with
how smart you are and a lot to do with how you behave. And behavior is hard
to teach, even to really smart people.

  `A genius who loses control of their emotions can be a financial disaster. The
opposite is also true. Ordinary folks with no financial education can be
wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do
with formal measures of intelligence.
My favorite Wikipedia entry begins: “Ronald James Read was an American
philanthropist, investor, janitor, and gas station attendant.”
Ronald Read was born in rural Vermont. He was the first person in his family
to graduate high school, made all the more impressive by the fact that he
hitchhiked to campus each day.
For those who knew Ronald Read, there wasn’t much else worth mentioning.
His life was about as low key as they come.
Read fixed cars at a gas station for 25 years and swept floors at JCPenney for
17 years. He bought a two-bedroom house for $12,000 at age 38 and lived
there for the rest of his life. He was widowed at age 50 and never remarried.

A friend recalled that his main hobby was chopping firewood.
Read died in 2014, age 92. Which is when the humble rural janitor made
international headlines.
2,813,503 Americans died in 2014. Fewer than 4,000 of them had a net worth
of over $8 million when they passed away. Ronald Read was one of them.
In his will the former janitor left $2 million to his stepkids and more than $6
million to his local hospital and library.
Those who knew Read were baffled. Where did he get all that money?
It turned out there was no secret. There was no lottery win and no
inheritance. Read saved what little he could and invested it in blue chip
stocks. Then he waited, for decades on end, as tiny savings compounded into
more than $8 million.`,
  `The fascinating thing about these stories is how unique they are to finance.
In what other industry does someone with no college degree, no training, no
background, no formal experience, and no connections massively outperform
someone with the best education, the best training, and the best connections?
I struggle to think of any.
It is impossible to think of a story about Ronald Read performing a heart
transplant better than a Harvard-trained surgeon. Or designing a skyscraper
superior to the best-trained architects. There will never be a story of a janitor
outperforming the world’s top nuclear engineers.
But these stories do happen in investing.
The fact that Ronald Read can coexist with Richard Fuscone has two
explanations. One, financial outcomes are driven by luck, independent of
intelligence and effort. That’s true to some extent, and this book will discuss
it in further detail. Or, two (and I think more common), that financial success
is not a hard science. It’s a soft skill, where how you behave is more
important than what you know.

I call this soft skill the psychology of money. The aim of this book is to use
short stories to convince you that soft skills are more important than the
technical side of money. I’ll do this in a way that will help everyone—from
Read to Fuscone and everyone in between—make better financial decisions.
These soft skills are, I’ve come to realize, greatly underappreciated.
Finance is overwhelmingly taught as a math-based field, where you put data
into a formula and the formula tells you what to do, and it’s assumed that
you’ll just go do it.
This is true in personal finance, where you’re told to have a six-month
emergency fund and save 10% of your salary.
It’s true in investing, where we know the exact historical correlations
between interest rates and valuations.`,
  `Let me tell you about a problem. It might make you feel better about what
you do with your money, and less judgmental about what other people do
with theirs.

People do some crazy things with money. But no one is crazy.

Here’s the thing: People from different generations, raised by different
parents who earned different incomes and held different values, in different
parts of the world, born into different economies, experiencing different job
markets with different incentives and different degrees of luck, learn very
different lessons.

Everyone has their own unique experience with how the world works. And
what you’ve experienced is more compelling than what you learn second-
hand. So all of us—you, me, everyone—go through life anchored to a set of
views about how money works that vary wildly from person to person. What
seems crazy to you might make sense to me.

The person who grew up in poverty thinks about risk and reward in ways the
child of a wealthy banker cannot fathom if he tried.`,
